- 👋 Hi, I’m @cfornesa on GitHub and LinkedIn.
- 👀 I’m interested in history, keeping up with the news, and creating art.  Additional passions include disability rights, LGBT rights, and, overall, learning about and dismantling myths, stereotypes, and other systemic issues that result in harm to minoritized populations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science through Boston University's MS in Data Science program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science and analysis opportunities.  I'm specifically interested in data that deals with improving the lives of minoritized populations.
- 📫 How to reach me cfornesa@bu.edu.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use my home art studio to study and practice playing my theremin (very badly), then drawing sometimes.
